Hi, I'm Samuel Ronsin, the author of this blog and creator of a x plus b. You can learn more about me here, follow me on [<a href="https://twitter.com/samronsin">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/samronsin">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://angel.co/samronsin">AngelList</a>].

The purpose of this blog is to engage in a conversation with crowdfunding campaigners, in order to crowdsource interesting questions that I can then ask the data.<br>
You're very welcome to comment on the posts or <a href="mailto:hello@axplusb.com">reach me</a> to address problems you had with your own campaign, past, current or forthcoming -- especially if you believe data analysis could be useful to solve it.

To power the analysis behind a x plus b, there are two main datasets which are designed to address two different kinds of questions.<br>
The first set gathers the final data of about 200 000 campaigns. It comprises anything I could extract from their static webpage: the goal, whether it was successful or not, the description of the project.<br>
The second dataset was made <a href="http://sidekick.epfl.ch/data">available</a> by <a href="http://vincent.etter.io/">Vincent Etter</a> from EPFL, following the <a href="http://vincent.etter.io/publications/etter2013cosn.pdf">article</a> he co-authored on the dynamics of crowdfunding campaigns. It features longitudinal data (i.e. consecutive updates on the temporary state of a campaign while it was live) from 16 000 campaigns.
